You can download, compile, and install `optool' with these simple
steps, using the freely available GNU FORTRAN compiler gfortran.

  git clone https://github.com/cdominik/optool.git        # clone repository
  cd optool                      # enter code directory
  make multi=true                # compile with multicore support
  
  make install bindir=~/bin/     # optional: copy binaries to binary path
  pip install -e .               # optional: install the python module

In the compilation step, use `multi=true' to add multicore support
(recommended!), `ifort=true' to use the Intel fortran compiler,
`fits=true' to support FITS files, and `oldio=true' if your
compiler does not have the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV module.

The executable is called `optool'. The `make install' step copies it
and also `optool2tex' and `optool-complete' into `bindir'.

For shell command line completion support, check the file
`optool-complete'.
