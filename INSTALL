*******************************************************************************
WARNING: The installation instructions have slightly changed, because
this package can now also be installed as a python package though pip
or similar means.  If you have used optool before and want to keep
using it in the same way, you now need to go into the directory
src/optool before you can call "make" to compile the code. That is the
only difference.
*******************************************************************************


You can download, compile, and install `optool' with these simple
steps, using the freely available GNU FORTRAN compiler gfortran.

  git clone https://github.com/cdominik/optool.git        # clone repository
  cd optool/src/optool           # enter code directory
  make multi=true                # compile with multicore support
  
  make install bindir=~/bin/     # optional: copy binaries to binary path
  pip install -e .               # optional: install the python module

In the compilation step, use `multi=true' to add multicore support
(recommended!), `ifort=true' to use the Intel fortran compiler,
`fits=true' to support FITS files, and `oldio=true' if your
compiler does not have the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV module.

The executable is called `optool'. The `make install' step copies it
and also `optool2tex' and `optool-complete' into `bindir'.

For shell command line completion support, check the file
`optool-complete'.
