This directory contains code snippets that read the output of optool,
both the ASCII files and the fits files.  If you are planning to use
opacities computed with optool in your code, this should get you
started quickly.

WARNING: Currently, these snippets do NOT deal with sparse files.


Python
======

If you are using optool from python, you can just call optool from
your code and use the caching mechanism to store the results between
calls:

For python, you might want to use the optool module to both run optool
and to read its output into a nice object.

    import optool
    p = optool.particle('optool -na 30 -d 5',cache='cdir1')
    p.__dict__

But if you prefer to read output files that are already available on
your system, you can use the snippets in the following 2 files:

 - readfits.py
 - readascii.py

FORTRAN
=======

The following 2 files contain code to read optool output files into
Fortran code.  For the fits file, you need to link the cfitsio library
into your program.

 - readfits.f90
 - readascii.f90
