This directory contains the axis-specific data for lnk files that are
compiled onto optool as a Bruggemann mix.

When you have crystals, the optical properties depend on the
orientation of the electric field relative to the structure of the
crystal. In Astronomy we do not have crystals in a specific
orientation.  Instead we can have two different situations.

1. Grains that are monocrystals. In this case we consider an ensemble
   of such crystals that are randomly oriented in space.

2. Grains made of a material in which small crystalline regions are
   mixed with random orientations in a single grain.

The computation of opacities for these two different situations
differs.

1. For situation 1, you need to compute independent opacities for each
   crystal orientation, and than average the opacities obtained in
   this way.

2. For situation 2, you would use the Bruggemann rule to mix the
   refractive index data, and then compute opacities just once, with
   the mixed refractive index data.

For the materials compiled into optool, situation 2 has been assumed.
If you want to work with situation 1, the axis-dependent data for some
crystalline optool materials is available in the directory
lnk_data/ad.
