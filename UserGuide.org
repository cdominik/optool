* Introduction

This tool produces complex dust particle opacities right from the
command line. It is derived from Michiel Min's DHS [[https://dianaproject.wp.st-andrews.ac.uk/data-results-downloads/fortran-package/][OpacityTool]] and
also implements Ryo Tazaki's MMF theory for highly porous aggregates.

** Capabilities

- stand-alone tool, fully command line driven, no input files need to
  be edited
- full scattering matrix output in several formats, including for
  RADMC-3D
- combining materials through mixing into a complex grain with
  porosity
- /built-in/: a curated collection of materials for applications in
  astronomy
- external refractive index data can be used just as easily
- computational methods: (i) *DHS (Distribution of Hollow Spheres)*
  for /irregular grains/ and /low-porosity/ aggregates.  Standard *Mie
  theory* for /perfect spheres/ is available as a limiting case. (ii)
  *MMF (Modified Mean Field)* theory for /high-porosity/fractal
  aggregates/. (iii) *CDE* approximation in the Rayleigh limit.
- =Python= interface module for plotting and post-processing

** Physical units used by optool
Due to conventions in our field, the input and output of =optool= uses
the following units:
| grain sizes and wavelengths.[fn:1]               | \mu{}m                     |
| mass densities of materials                      | g cm^-3                    |
| opacities \kappa_abs, \kappa_sca, \kappa_ext     | cm^2 g^-1                  |
| scattering matrix, see [[#normalization][App. B.1]]                  | sr^-1 /or/ cm^2 g^-1 sr^-1 |


[fn:1]When giving a grain size or a wavelength on the command line,
you can write =1.3*mm=, =340*GHz=, or =4000/cm= and =optool= will do
the right thing, converting to 1300\mu{}m, 881.7\mu{}m, and 2.5\mu{}m,
respectively.

* Examples
A simple grain made only of the default pyroxene, for the default
grain size distribution ($a^{-3.5}$ powerlaw from 0.05 to 3000\mu{}m),
on the default wavelength grid (0.05\mu{}m to 1cm).

#+begin_src sh
optool pyr
#+end_src

Include the scattering matrix in the produced output

#+begin_src sh
optool pyr -s
#+end_src

(70% Mg) and carbon, in a mass ratio 0.87/0.13, and with a porosity of
25%.

#+begin_src sh
optool pyr-mg70 0.87  c 0.13  -p 0.25

#+end_src

Pure water ice grains in a narrow size distribution from 1 to 3
microns, with 15 sample sizes following an $f(a)\propto a^{-2.5}$
powerlaw size distribution. Also, restrict the wavelength range to
10-100\mu{}m, and turn off DHS to get perfect spheres (Mie).

#+begin_src sh
optool h2o  -a 1 3 2.5 15  -l 10 100 -mie
#+end_src

Use a log-normal size distribution around 2 \mu{}m with \sigma=0.7 instead.

* Installation
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: compilation
:END:
** Direct compilation from source code
You can download, compile, and install =optool= with these simple
steps, using the freely available GNU FORTRAN compiler [[https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortran][=gfortran=]].

: git clone https://github.com/cdominik/optool.git        # clone repository
: cd optool/src/optool           # enter code directory
: make multi=true                # compile with multicore support

: make install bindir=~/bin/     # optional: copy binaries to binary path
: pip install -e .               # optional: install the python module

In the compilation step, use =multi=true= to add multicore support
(recommended!), =ifort=true= to use the [[https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/compilers/fortran-compilers.html][Intel fortran compiler]],
=fits=true= to support FITS files[fn:2], and =oldio=true= if your
compiler does not have the =ISO_FORTRAN_ENV= module.

The executable is called =optool=, run it with =./optool= or move it
onto your binary path.

# For shell command line completion support, check the file
# =optool-complete=.

[fn:2] This requires the [[https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio/][=cfitsio=]] library to be installed on your
system.

* Command line arguments
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: command-line-arguments
:END:

+ =-h [OPT]= :: Show command line option summary, or specific
  information about option *=-OPT=*.
+ =-q= :: Reduce output to STDOUT to essential warnings and errors.
+ =-v= :: More verbose output to STDOUT.

** Grain composition
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: composition
:END:
If no composition is specified, the (DIANA) default is *-c pyr 0.87 -c c 0.13
-p 0.25*.

+ =-c= :: List available built-in materials (the keys for the *-c* and
  *-m* options).

+ =[-c] MATERIAL [MFRAC]= ::

  Specify a material to include in the grain. =MATERIAL= can be the
  [[#builtin-materials][key for a builtin material]], the [[#lnk-files][path to an =lnk= file]], or
  colon-separated numbers =n:k:rho=[fn:3]. =MFRAC= is
  the /mass/ fraction (default 1.0) of the material. You can give up
  to 20 materials to build up the grain.  Mass fractions do not have
  to add up to one, they will be renormalized.  All materials will be
  mixed together using the /Bruggeman/ rule, and vacuum can be added
  through the porosity. *-c* in front of each material is
  optional.

+ =-m MATERIAL [MFRAC]= ::

  Like *-c*, but place this material into the grain mantle. Multiple
  mantle materials will be mixed using the Bruggeman rule, and then
  that mix will be added to the core using the /Maxwell-Garnett/ rule.
  The *-m* is /not/ optional, it must be present.

+ =-p POROSITY [P_MANTLE]= ::

  Porosity, the /volume/ fraction of vacuum, a number smaller than 1.
  The default is 0.  A single value will apply to both core and
  mantle, but a second value will be specific for the mantle (and may
  be 0).

+ =-diana, -dsharp=, =-dsharp-no-ice= :: Use DIANA (Woitke+2016) or
  DSHARP (Birnstiel+2018) compositions.

[fn:3] =n:k:rho= specifies a refractive index =m=n+ik= and a material
density =rho= (in g/cm^3) for a quick calculation at a single
wavelength, for example for use in statistical inference on a
refractive index.

** Grain geometry and computational method

If no method is explicitly specified, the default is *-dhs 0.8*, i.e.
DHS with f_max=0.8.

+ =-dhs [FMAX]= ::
  Use the /Distribution of Hollow Spheres/ (DHS, Min+ 2005) approach
  to model deviations from perfect spherical symmetry and low-porosity
  aggregates. Spheres with inner holes with volume fractions between 0
  and f_max (default 0.8) are averaged to mimic irregularities.
  f_max=0 means to use solid spheres (Mie theory),
  i.e. perfectly regular grains. For backward compatibility, *-fmax*
  can be used instead of *-dhs*.

+ =-mmf [A0 [DFRAC-OR-FILL [KF]]]= ::

  Use /Modified Mean Field/ theory (MMF, Tazaki & Tanaka 2018) to
  compute opacities of highly porous or fractal aggregates.  *-c*,
  *-m*, and *-p* determine the composition of monomers with radius
  =A0= (default 0.1\mu{}m).  Particles will be aggregates with a
  /compact size/ given by the *-a* switch, giving rise to
  $N=a^3/a_0^3$ monomers. =DFRAC-OR-FILL= specifies either the fractal
  dimension (if >1) or the /volume filling factor/ (if <1). The
  default is 0.2. KF may be used to change the default prefactor.

+ =-mie= ::
  Do a standard Mie calculation for perfect spheres.  This is short
  for *-dhs 0*.

+ =-cde= :: 

  Compute CDE (continuous distribution of ellipsoids) Rayleigh limit
  opacities.


** Grain size distribution

+ =-a AMIN [AMAX [APOW [NA]]]= \hfill{}(powerlaw size distribution) ::
  Specify (minimum) grain radius, and optionally maximum grain radius,
  the [[#sizedist][size distribution powerlaw]] and the number of size bins.  You may
  also use options to set individual values with *-amin*, *-amax*,
  *-apow*, *-na*. The defaults are 0.05 \mu{}m, 3000 \mu{}m, 3.5, and
  /15 per size decade with a fixed minimum of 5/, respectively.\\
  =>= If only a single size is specified with *-a*, then a_max=a_min and
  n_a=1 are implied.

+ =-a AMIN AMAX AMEAN:ASIG [NA]= \hfill{} ([log-]normal size distribution) ::
  Specify the centroid size and the logarithmic width for a [[#sizedist][log-normal
  size distribution]]. You may also use *-amean* and *-asig* options to
  set these values. If =ASIG= is negative, create a [[#sizedist][normal distribution]]
  with that width (in \mu{}m) around =AMEAN=.

+ =-a FILE= ::
  Read the size distribution from a file. The file format is described
  in [[#sizedist][appendix A]].  To get an example file =optool_sd.dat=, run =optool=
  with the option *-w*.
  
** Wavelength grid

+ =-l LMIN [LMAX [NLAM]]= ::

  Specify the (minimum) wavelength, and optionally the maximum
  wavelength and the number of wavelengths points for the construction
  of the wavelength grid.  The default values are 0.05 \mu{}m, 10000
  \mu{}m, and 300, respectively.  You may also use the options
  *-lmin*, *-lmax*, and *-nlam* (or *-nl*) to set individual values.\\
  =>= If only one wavelength is specified with *-l*, then
  \lambda_max=\lambda_min and n_\lambda=1 are implied.

+ =-l FILE= ::

  Read the wavelength grid from =FILE=. To get an example file
  =optool_lam.dat=, run =optool= with the option *-w*. An [[#lnk-files][=lnk=]]
  file could be used here as well!

** Controlling the output

The standard output is the file [[#output-files][=dustkappa.dat=]], with the opacities
and the asymmetry parameter /g/. The following options control and
extend the [[#output-files][output]].

+ =-o [DIR]= ::

  Put the output files in directory =DIR= instead of the current
  working directory. =./output= will be used if *-o* is present but
  =DIR= is not specified.

+ =-s [NANG]= ::

  Include the scattering matrix in the output. NANG may optionally
  change the number of equally-spaced [[#angular-grid][angular grid points]] to cover
  the range of angles between 0 and 180 degrees.  The default for
  =NANG= is 180 and should normally be just fine.

+ =-d [NSUB]= ::

  Divide the computation up into n_a parts to produce a file for each
  grain size.  Each size will be an average over a range of =NSUB=
  (default 5) grains around the real size.

+ =-chop [NDEG]= ::

  Cap the first =NDEG= (2 if unspecified) degrees of the [[#forward-scattering-peak][forward
  scattering peak]].

+ =-fits= ::

  Write [[#output-files][=dustkappa.fits=]] instead of ASCII output.  With =-d=, write
  n_a files.

+ =-radmc [LABEL]= ::

  RADMC-3D uses a different angular grid and [[#normalization][scattering matrix]]
  normalization. File names will contain =LABEL= if specified and have
  the extension =.inp=.

+ =-print [KEY]= ::
  Write to =STDOUT= instead of files. The default is to write \lambda,
  \kappa_abs, \kappa_sca, \kappa_ext, and g. Many other outputs are
  possible, run =optool -print ?= for a full list. For readability, a
  header line may be printed to =STDERR=, but =STDOUT= gets only numbers
  which can be used in pipes and for redirection. You can use this to
  extract a single value, for example the 850\mu{}m extinction opacity
  of grains between 1 and 3mm: =optool -a 1000 3000 -l 850 -print
  kext=.

+ =-w= ::
  Write the files =optool_sd.dat= and =optool_lam.dat= with the grain
  size distribution and the wavelength grid, respectively. Also,
  write =optool_mix.lnk= with the result of mixing refractive index
  data. Exit without doing a computation.



#+LaTeX: \newpage
* Material properties
=optool= needs refractive index data to work.  For your convenience, a
useful list of materials is compiled into =optool=. You can also find
and use other data.

** Built-in materials
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: builtin-materials
:END:

To access one of the built-in materials, specify the corresponding key
string like =pyr-mg70=. In each material class we have selected a
useful default, accessible with an even simpler generic key (for
example, =pyr= is an alias for =pyr-mg70=). Most of the built-in
refractive index datasets have a reasonably wide wavelength coverage -
the few exceptions are highlighted by bold-face numbers.  If a
material is being used outside of the measured region, =optool= will
still function, using extrapolated optical properties.

Even the limited number of materials we have selected to include with
=optool= can be daunting. To get started with some kind of standard
opacity, we recommend to work with pyroxene \fbox{pyr}, carbon
\fbox{c}, and, at low temperatures, water ice \fbox{h2o} (Woitke+
2016). If you need to account for sulfur, you may want to include
troilite \fbox{tro} (Birnstiel+ 2016).

** External refractory index files (=lnk= files)
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: lnk-files
:END:

=optool= can use external refractive index data in files with the
following format[fn:5]:
- The file may start with several comment lines (lines starting with
  =!=, =#=, or =*=).
- The next line contains two numbers, the number of wavelengths
  $n_\lambda$ and the specific density \rho of the material in
  g/cm^{3}.
- The remaining lines should form three columns of data:
  \lambda[\mu{}m] (sorted either up or down), and the real and
  imaginary parts of the refractive index, $n$ and $k$.

We provide additional data ready for use with =optool= in [[https://github.com/cdominik/optool-additional-refind-data][a separate
repository]]. Other resources are the [[https://www.astro.uni-jena.de/Laboratory/Database/databases.html][Jena database]], [[http://eodg.atm.ox.ac.uk/ARIA/][ARIA]] and original
papers in the literature. Don't forget to add the line with
$n_\lambda$ and \rho!  If that is not possible, =optool= will count
the lines and you can specify the density after the mass fraction,
like this: =optool -c path/to/file.lnk 0.7 3.42=.  Please include
references for any optical properties used in your study.

[fn:5]This file structure is also compatible with what is
needed to set the wavelength grid with *-l FILE*.

#+LATEX: \newpage

** One-off materials
For a calculation at a single wavelength you can give the refractive
index on the command line, like this: =optool 1.57:0.56:2.08 -l 0.74
-s=. This example specifies the refractive index of $m=1.57+0.56i$ for
a material with a density of 2.08g/cm^3, and the computation of the
scattering matrix will be done at a wavelength of 0.74\mu{}m.

* Output files
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: output-files
:END:

- dustkappa.dat ::

  This is an ASCII file containing the basic opacity results. It
  starts with a comment section describing the dust model and also
  showing the exact command line that was used to produce the file.
  The header is followed by the format number (3, currently), followed
  by the number of wavelengths in the grid, both on lines by
  themselves. This is followed by a block with these columns:

  1. wavelength \lambda [micron]
  2. mass absorption cross section \kappa_abs [cm^2/g]
  3. mass scattering cross section \kappa_sca [cm^2/g]
  4. asymmetry parameter /g/

- dustkapscatmat.dat ::

  ASCII file with cross sections and full scattering matrix. It is an
  extended version of the =dustkappa.dat= file.  This file has a
  format number (0), the number of wavelengths and then the number of
  angular points after the comment section.  After an empty line, the
  same opacity block as in =dustkappa.dat= is present.  Another empty
  line is followed by a list of the grid angles, another empty
  line, and then the scattering matrix elements for all wavelengths
  and all angles. The comment section at the start of the file shows
  the structure in a formal way.  See [[#normalization][appendix B.1]] for information
  about the normalization of the scattering matrix and about the
  angular grid that is used for it.  Also, see the =-radmc= switch
  which will modify[fn:6] the output to make sure it can be used as an
  input file for [[http://www.ita.uni-heidelberg.de/~dullemond/software/radmc-3d/][RADMC-3D]].

  To save space, =optool= can write a /sparse file/ (iformat=100) that
  stores the full scattering matrix only for selected wavelengths (for
  example, the ones that will be used for image generation). Use =-sp
  LAM= or =-sp LAM1 LAM2= to define a wavelength (interval)[fn:7] for
  the matrix to be stored. Multiple =-sp= switches are allowed.

- dustkappa.fits ::

  The FITS-file is written when using the =-fits= switch. It has two
  HDU blocks. The first contains the cross sections per unit mass
  (units cm^2/g). It is a n_\lambda \times 4 matrix with these columns:
  wavelength in micron, \kappa_ext, \kappa_abs, \kappa_sca.  The
  second block is a n_\lambda \times 6 \times n_ang matrix, containing
  the 6 elements of the scattering matrix (F_11, F_12, F_22, F_33,
  F_34, and F_44) for n_ang equidistant scattering angles from forward
  scattering (element 0) to backward scattering (element n_ang-1), for
  each \lambda.

- optool.tex ::

  As a little gimmick, you can run =optool2tex= with the exact same
  command line arguments as used in an =optool= run. =optool.tex= then
  contains text and a table, describing the methods used for the
  opacity computation and listing the composition of the grains. All
  relevant references are given - the BibTeX file =optool.bib= is
  required for the file to be processed properly. You can rework this
  text to include it into your paper. For more details, read the
  comment section in =optool2tex=.

- optool\underline{ }mix.lnk ::

  When using the =-w= switch, =optool= will write the result of mixing
  to this file.

- optool\underline{ }sd.dat & optool\underline{ }lam.dat ::

  When using the =-w= switch, =optool= will write the grain size grid
  and the wavelength grid to two files. The files serve as example
  files for what the structure of files need to be to be read in with
  =-a file.dat= and =-l file.dat= for user-provided size and
  wavelength grids.

[fn:6] This includes a change of the angular grid and a change in the
normalization of the scattering matrix. The format number will be 1
(or 101 for a sparse file).

[fn:7] The file will always have the matrix for at least two adjacent
wavelengths around the specified \lambda, so that an interpolation to
the exact wavelength will be stable.

* Python interface
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: python
:END:

=optool= comes with a [[https://www.python.org/][=python=]] module[fn:8] =optool.py= that runs =optool=
in the background[fn:9] and puts all computed quantities as =numpy=
arrays into a python object.  This makes it straight forward to
inspect and further process the output. Here is how to use it:

#+begin_src python
import optool
p = optool.particle("~/bin/optool pyr 0.8 -m h2o 0.2 -na 24 -d")
#+end_src

The argument to =optool.particle()= must be a valid shell
command[fn:10] to run =optool=, if necessary with the full path to the
=optool= binary.  Depending on the presence of the =optool='s *-d*
switch, the command will produce opacities either for $n_p=1$
particle, or for $n_p=n_a$ particles. Most of the attributes (with the
exception of the global wavelength and angular grids) will therefore
be arrays with the first dimension equal to $n_p$, even if
$n_p=1$. The resulting object will have the following attributes:

Applying the =plot()= method to a =particle= object like =p.plot()=
will show (see Fig 1):
- a plot showing the opacities \kappa_abs, \kappa_sca, and \kappa_ext
  as a function of wavelength, along with the asymmetry parameter /g/
  (on a linear y-scale).  Note that the blue /g/ curve does not have
  its own axis, imagine the full /y/ axis going from 0 to 1 for /g/.
- a plot showing the scattering matrix elements as a function of
  scattering angle, with sliders to go through grain sizes and
  wavelengths.  When interpreting the y axis, note that we plot the
  positive/negative $\log_{10}$ of positive/negative matrix elements,
  compressing the range from $10^{-2}$ to $10^2$ into a line (use the
  grey lines as a guide, ignore the y-axis labels). If you cannot see
  F_11, it is because it is equal to and hidden behind F_22. If you
  cannot see F_33, it is because it is equal to and hidden behind
  F_44.
- If the =computemean= method has been called first, the mean
  opacities \kappa_Planck and \kappa_Ross are shown in a separate
  plot.  The mean opacities are per unit of grain mass, so please
  apply a dust-to-gas mass ratio to obtain opacities for a gas-dust
  mixture.

The python module has a few more tricks up its sleeve (for details
check the documentation inside the Python module file =optool.py=):

- You can cache results of an expensive computation for quick
  reloading in a new python session.  When running the following
  command twice, =optool= will be called only the first time. The
  cache will reside in the specified directory.
  #+begin_src python
  sil = optool.particle("optool -d ol-mg50 -na 100",cache="silcache")
  #+end_src
- You can read the results directory created by another run of optool
  by leaving the command parameter empty and specifying the directory
  as the second parameter.
  #+begin_src python

* Size distribution
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sizedist
:END:

=optool= implements powerlaw, log-normal, and normal size
distributions.  Each of these will be subject to a minimum and a
maximum grain size. The grain size grid is logarithmic, so $da\propto
a$. The logarithmic bins are then filled according to:
| powerlaw                                           | \quad $n(a)\propto a^{-p+1}$                                                                     |
| log-normal distribution, triggered by $\sigma>0$   | \quad $n(a)\propto \exp\left[-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\ln (a/a_{\rm m})}{\sigma}\right)^2\right]$ |
| normal distribution[fn:11], triggered by $\sigma<0$       | \quad $n(a)\propto \exp\left[-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{a-a_{\rm m}}{\sigma}\right)^2\right]$       |

Other size distributions can be constructed using the [[#python][python
interface]].  Finally, =optool= can also read a size distribution from a
file, and this is also the way to provide an arbitrary size grid. The
first data line in the file gives the number of grain size bins,
followed by lines with two numbers each: grain size in micron and
number of grains in the corresponding bin. To get an example file, run
=optool= with the option *-w*):

[fn:11]   A normal distribution is not sampled symmetrically on a
logarithmic size grid - please make sure your sampling is fine enough
around the mean size.
* Scattering Matrix: The fine print


** Phase function normalization
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: normalization
:END:
A number of different normalizations for the scattering matrix are
being used in the literature and in computational tools. The
differences are significant, and it is important to be aware of the
choice. For =optool= we are using a convention ([[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004nsm..rept....1H][Hovenier (2004)]]) in
which the average over all directions of the 1-1 element of the
scattering matrix equals unity, i.e. the integral will be 4\pi:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:1}
\oint_{(4\pi)} F_{11}(\lambda,\Theta) d\Omega = 
2\pi \int_{-1}^{1} F_{11}(\lambda,\mu) {\rm d}\mu= 4\pi \quad ,
\end{equation}

with $\mu=\cos\Theta$. =optool= can also produce output for [[http://www.ita.uni-heidelberg.de/~dullemond/software/radmc-3d/][RADMC-3D]]
which uses instead

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:2}
\oint_{(4\pi)} Z_{11}(\lambda,\Theta) d\Omega =
2\pi \int_{-1}^{1} Z_{11}(\lambda,\mu) {\rm d}\mu =
 \kappa_{\rm sca}(\lambda) \quad .
\end{equation}

The books by Bohren & Huffman and by Mishchenko use different
normalizations again. You can change the normalization of the
scattering matrix in the python interface with the =scatnorm()=
method. By default, that method checks the current normalization.
Using an argument ='r'=, ='b'=, ='m'=, or ='h'= will modify the
normalization.

** Forward-scattering peak
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: forward-scattering-peak
:END:

Particles that are much larger than the wavelength of the considered
radiation can show extreme forward scattering, where much of the
/scattered/ radiation is sent into just a few degrees around the
forward direction.  This can be difficult to handle for radiative
transfer codes which have limited angular resolution or limited
sampling. [[http://exoclouds.com/Software/][MCMax3D]] has the =nspike= keyword to deal with this
issue. Other tools (e.g. RADMC-3D) require this to be taken care of by
the process that creates the opacity files.  The =-chop= switch
specifies a number of degrees around the forward scattering
direction. Inside that cone, the scattering matrix gets limited to the
value at the edge of the cone. To compensate and ensure energy
conservation, the scattering cross section will be reduced
accordingly. As a result, the radiation that would be /scattered/ into
this narrow range of angles will be treated as if it did have /no
interaction at all/ with the grain.


** Angular grid
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: angular-grid
:END:

=optool= uses an angular grid in one-degree steps from 0 to 180
degrees.  The full degrees are the cell /interfaces/ of that
grid. =optool= computes the scattering matrix at the cell /midpoints/,
i.e. at 0.5\deg, 1.5\deg etc to 179.5\deg, for a total of 180 values.
The scattering matrix is normalized in this way, so that a numerical
integral gives the correct result.

RADMC-3D requires the values of the scattering matrix on the cell
/boundaries/, so at 0\deg, 1\deg etc to 180\deg, for a total of 181
values.  For the input files for RADMC-3D, we interpolate and extend
the computed values to the cell boundaries.

* More on optical properties

** Crystalline materials
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: crystalline_mixing
:END:
Crystalline materials have optical properties that are dependent on
the relative orientation of the electric field of the incoming
radiation and the crystallographic axes of the material. A fully
correct treatment would require the use of the refractive index
/tensor/ which is not implemented in optool (DDA can in principle do
that). There are two approximations that can be used. For the
materials built into =optool= we have assumed that the material
consists of /many small crystalline areas that are randomly oriented
within each grain/. For this, the refractive index data for different
orientations have been combined using the Bruggeman effective medium
rule. It results in a single refractive index data set. However, we
can also think of a situation where /each dust grain is a single
crystal in a cloud of randomly oriented grains/. In that case, we need
to compute opacities for individual orientations, and then average the
opacities. Axis-specific data is (when available) also included in the
optool distribution, in the =lnk_data/ad= directory. You could use the
[[#python][python interface]] to do this kind of mixing in the following way:
#+latex: \begin{small}
#+begin_src python
import optool
px = optool.particle("optool -a 1.5 lnk_data/ad/c-gra-x-Draine2003.lnk")
py = optool.particle("optool -a 1.5 lnk_data/ad/c-gra-y-Draine2003.lnk")
pz = optool.particle("optool -a 1.5 lnk_data/ad/c-gra-z-Draine2003.lnk")
pmix = (px+py+pz)/3.
#+end_src
#+latex: \end{small}

** How to ingest refractive index data for another material
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: ingest
:END:

Using external refractive index data means that you have to keep track
of where those files are.  It can be convenient to compile your
favorite materials into =optool=, so that accessing them will be as
simple as using the [[#builtin-materials][built-in materials]].  Here is how to do that:

1. Give your =lnk= file a name exactly like
   =pyr-mg70-Dorschner1995.lnk=, where the start of the name
   (=pyr-mg70=) is the key to access the material and =Dorschner1995=
   (the text after the final =-=) is the reference.
2. Put this file into the =lnk_data= directory.
3. Optionally edit =lnk_data/lnk-help.txt=, so that [[#composition][=optool -c=]] will
   list the new material.  Note that, in order to define /generic keys/,
   optool looks for pairs that look like =genkey -> fullkey= in this file.
4. Run =make ingest= to update =optool_refind.f90=, now with your new
   material.
5. Recompile and install the code.


** Overview of optical properties

The grid plot in Fig. 2 shows the imaginary parts of all built-in
materials, in the wavelength range from 0.05 to 300 \mu{}m.  Some if
the ices have only data in a small range, where the vibrational
transitions lie.  However, these materials can be used over a much
broader wavelength range, because the extrapolation becomes
problematic only in the UV where electronic transitions kick in.

* Internals
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: internals
:END:
This appendix describes some key aspects of the internal workings of
the code.

- Refractive index data :: Measured refractive index data is obtained
  from data compiled into the code, or read-in from a file.  That data
  is then interpolated and extrapolated onto the wavelength grid
  requested for the computation. Extrapolation toward short
  wavelengths is done keeping the refractive indices constant.
  Extrapolation toward long wavelengths assumes that the last two
  measured data points define a powerlaw. Interpolation in the
  measured grid is done using double-logarithmic interpolation.

- Mixing :: Once the refractive index for all involved materials is
  available, the core and the mantle mixtures are created
  independently, using the Bruggeman rule.  Mass fractions are
  converted into volume fractions, and porosity is implemented using
  vacuum as an additional material.  The subroutine doing the mixing
  uses an iterative procedure that is very stable, also for a large
  number of components.\\
  If there is a mantle, the Maxwell-Garnett rule is applied with the
  core being treated as an inclusion inside a mantle matrix.\\
  With a =-w= switch, =optool= will write result of mixing
  into the file =optool_mix.lnk=.

- DHS :: In order to simulate irregularities in grains (irregular
  shapes, or the properties of low-porosity aggregates), =optool=
  averages the opacities of grains with an inner empty region, over a
  range of volume fractions of this inner region between 0 and $f_{\rm
  max}$. The subroutine used to compute the opacities and scattering
  matrix elements for these structures is =DMiLay= (Toon & Ackerman
  1981). For speed, you can use =-xlim 1e3= or so to set a limit for
  the size parameter ($x=2\pi a/\lambda$) where =optool= switches from
  DHS to Mie[fn:12]. In rare cases, =DMiLay= might not converge and
  return an error. =optool= then falls back to a Mie computation,
  using the routine =MeerhoffMie= (de Rooij+ 1984), with a size
  parameter limit to ensure stability. In a situation where the
  imaginary part of the refractive index is extremely small, numerical
  inaccuracies may lead to an unphysical result with $q_{\rm
  sca}>q_{\rm ext}$, implying a small negative $q_{\rm abs}$. =optool=
  therefore enforces $q_{\rm abs}>q_{\rm ext}/10^4$.

- MMF :: To construct fluffy/fractal aggregates, =optool= needs the
  number of monomers $N$, the fractal dimension $D_{\rm f}$, and a
  scaling factor $k_{\rm f}$ which are related to the radius of
  gyration $R_{\rm g}$ of the aggregate by $N=k_{\rm f}(R_{\rm
  g}/a_0)^{D_{\rm f}}$.  The size $a$ of the particles as specified by
  the *-a* switch is interpreted as the /compact/[fn:13] size of all
  material in the aggregate, so that $N=a^3/a_0^3$, where $a_0$ is the
  monomer radius.  The average volume filling factor $f$ can be
  expressed by $f=N\cdot(\sqrt{3/5}\,a_0/R_{\rm g})^3$.  To determine
  the structure of the aggregates, the user can specify a structure
  parameter.  If that parameter is >1, it is interpreted as
  the /fractal dimension/ $D_{\rm f}$.  Using a fixed fractal
  dimension means that the volume filling factor will decrease with
  aggregate size.  If the parameter is <1, it is interpreted as a
  fixed /volume filling factor/ $f$ that applies to all aggregate
  sizes - with the implication that then the fractal dimension
  increases as a function of size. The fractal prefactor $k_{\rm f}$
  is chosen automatically so that the asymptotic density of small
  aggregates is the monomer material density. To force another value
  for the prefactor, it can be given explicitly as the third value of
  the =mmf= option. The following table summarizes the relevant
  equations.

  |             | =-mmf A0 DF=          | =-mmf A0 FILL=        | =-mmf A0 DF KF=                                           |
  |-------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------|
  | /           | <                     | <                     | <                                                         |
  | $f$         | $N^{(D_{\rm f}-3)/3}$ | *given by user*       | $\sqrt{27/125}\,k_{\rm f}^{3/D_{\rm f}}N^{3-1/D_{\rm f}}$ |
  | $D_{\rm f}$ | *given by user*       | $3\ln N\,/\,\ln(N/f)$ | *given by user*                                           |
  | $k_{\rm f}$ | $(5/3)^{D_{\rm f}/2}$ | $(5/3)^{D_{\rm f}/2}$ | *given by user*                                           |

  With the structure defined, =optool= then applies the formalism from
  Tazaki & Tanaka (2018) and Tazaki (2021) to compute cross sections
  and the scattering matrix.  =optool= also computes the phase shift
  $\Delta\phi$ to check the validity of the scattering matrix.  If the
  condition $\Delta\phi<1$ for accurate scattering matrix results is
  violated, a warning will be issued and the scattering matrix will be
  set to zero at the relevant wavelengths. However, the opacities will
  remain applicable. You can request to get the result computed under
  the assumption of single scattering at wavelengths where the phase
  shift is too large. This may be usable for absorbing materials, but
  we do not have a clear criterion on when it will be accurate. For
  this result, use *-mmfss* instead of *-mmf*. =optool= will then also print
  the wavelength below which the scattering matrix needs to be used
  with caution.

- CDE :: CDE (Continuous Distribution of Ellipsoids) is an analytical
  formalism by Bohren & Huffman (1998) to compute the opacity of a
  very broad shape distribution.  This method is only applicable in
  the Rayleigh limit $x=2\pi a\ll\lambda$ and $|mx|\ll1$. =optool=
  will issue a warning if the computation leaves the bounds of this
  condition. The scattering matrix will be computed from a single
  sphere in the Rayleigh limit.

[fn:12] The default limit is x_lim=10^{8}. A smaller value is OK in
applications where the short wavelength opacity is dominated by
smaller particles. =optool= does the alternative
Mie computation with a slightly increased grain diameter, representing
the mean geometric cross section of the DHS spheres, to connect well
to the DHS opacities.

[fn:13]still including the porosity specified with the *-p* switch
(which is porosity residing in the monomers themselves), but not any
"porosity" resulting from the aggregate structure

* Troubleshooting
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: trouble_shooting
:END:

1. If you get a compilation error about the intrinsic module
   =ISO_FORTRAN_ENV=, compile with =make oldio=true=.
2. If you get oscillations in the opacities, in particular at long
   wavelengths, the grain size resolution is not sufficient.  Use more
   grain sizes (*-a*, *-na* and *-d* switches).
3. If you do not remember how to reproduce a specific run, check the
   output file header. It contains the exact command that was used to
   produce the file.
4. If the =optool= command is not found by your shell, make sure the
   =optool= executable is on your binary search path.  Or run it by
   giving the full path, like =./optool=.
