* Introduction to optool

This tool produces complex dust particle opacities right from the
command line. It is derived from Michiel Min's DHS [[https://dianaproject.wp.st-andrews.ac.uk/data-results-downloads/fortran-package/][OpacityTool]] and
also implements Ryo Tazaki's MMF theory for highly porous aggregates.

* Capabilities

- stand-alone tool, fully command line driven, no input files need to
  be edited
- full scattering matrix output in several formats, including for
  RADMC-3D
- combining materials through mixing into a complex grain with
  porosity
- /built-in/: a curated collection of materials for applications in
  astronomy
- external refractive index data can be used just as easily. A
  selection of readily prepared files can be found [[https://github.com/cdominik/optool-additional-refind-data][here]].
- computational methods: (i) *DHS (Distribution of Hollow Spheres)*
  for /irregular grains/ and /low-porosity/ aggregates.  Standard *Mie
  theory* for /perfect spheres/ is available as a limiting case. (ii)
  *MMF (Modified Mean Field)* theory for /high-porosity/fractal
  aggregates/.  (iii) *CDE (Continuous Distribution of Ellipsoids)*
  approximation in the Rayleigh limit.
- =Python= interface module for plotting and post-processing

* Examples
A simple grain made only of the default pyroxene, for the default
grain size distribution (a^{-3.5} powerlaw from 0.05 to 3000\mu{}m),
on the default wavelength grid (0.05\mu{}m to 1cm).

: optool pyr

Include the scattering matrix in the produced output

: optool pyr -s

Reproduce the DIANA standard dust model, using a specific pyroxene
(70% Mg) and carbon, in a mass ratio 0.87/0.13, and with a porosity of
25%.

: optool pyr-mg70 0.87  c 0.13  -p 0.25

List the built-in materials

: optool -c

Add a water ice mantle (built-in data from Warren+08) that is 20% of
the core mass

: optool pyr-mg70 0.87  c 0.13  -m h2o-w 0.2  -p 0.25

Like the previous example, but use ice refractive index data from a
separate file.

: optool pyr-mg70 0.87  c 0.13  -p 0.25  -m data/ice_hudgins.dat 0.2

Pure water ice grains in a narrow size distribution from 1 to 3
microns, with 15 sample sizes following an f(a)\propto a^{-2.5}
powerlaw size distribution. Also, restrict the wavelength range to
10-100\mu{}m, and turn off DHS to get perfect spheres.

: optool h2o  -a 1 3 2.5 15  -l 10 100 -fmax 0

Use a log-normal size distribution around 2 \mu{}m with \sigma=0.7 instead.

: optool h2o  -a 0.1 30 2.0:0.7  -l 10 100 -mie

For silicon carbide, compute the opacity of a single grains size (2.5\mu{}m)
at \lambda=8.9\mu{}m.

: optool -a 2.5 -l 8.9 sic

Represent the default dust model (DIANA, you also get this when you do
not give any materials at all) in 42 grain sizes, and produce input
files for RADMC-3D, one for each grain size, with full scattering
matrix, chopping 3 degrees from the scattering peak.

: optool -na 42 -d -s -radmc -chop 3

Use MMF to compute the opacities of dust aggregates made of pyroxene
monomers.  Use a monomer radius of 0.3 \mu{}m to construct aggregates
with compact-volume radii between 10 and 30 \mu{}m, and a fractal
dimension of 1.9.

: optool pyr  -a 10 30  -mmf 0.3 1.9

Compute the CDE approximation of small graphite grains.

: optool gra  -a 0.01 0.1 -l 1 30 -cde

* User Guide
See the [[file:UserGuide.pdf][User Guide]] for more information.
* Important changes
- Release 2.0 ::
  - The structure of the package has changed. You now need to go into
    the directory =src/optool= before you can type "make" to compile
    the code.
  - optool is now also distributed as a python package that you can
    install via pip.  See the Userguide and the INSTALL files for
    instructions. 
  - A new switch, -err, makes sure optool returns an exit code of 1
    when it fails. This is useful when calling optool from other
    programs instead of from the command line.
- Release 1.9.14 ::
  - The python interface can now read the results from an earlier run
    by leaving the CMD argument empty.
    :   part = optool.particle("","path/to/directory")
    This is useful, for example, if you precompute many opacities that
    you then want to read with a python program. Thanks to Julien
    Milli for the request.

- Release 1.9.13 ::
  - The -print command line option allows a richer variety of outputs
    to STDOUT, for human reading as well as for use in a pipe or
    redirect. Run =optool -print ?= for a list of options.

- Release 1.9.12 ::
  - A material can now also be described by giving values for n, k,
    and the density on the command line, like this: =-c n:k:rho=.  For
    example, -c 2.5:0.3:3.01 describes a material with a complex
    refractive index of 2.5+0.3i and a mass density of 3.01 g/cm^3.
    This can be useful in parameter searches when trying to fit
    optical properties of an unknown material.

- Release 1.9.11 ::
  - New subdirectory =lnk_data/ad= contains the crystalline Axis
    dependant Data for some of the crystalline materials in the
    distribution. This allows to create opacity mix computations as
    opposed to the refractive index mixing that has been used to
    produce the crystalline datasets in optool. See appendix D.1 in
    the UserGuide.

- Release 1.9.10 ::
  - STDOUT and STDERR are now properly separated and portable, using
    the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV module.

- Release 1.9.9 ::
  - More careful treatment of short-wavelength computation using very
    large grains with size parameter x>1e4. This change makes the code
    slower for computation involving very large size parameters.  Use
    =-xlim 1e4= to get back the old speed if that bothers you, and if
    in your application the short-wavelength opacities are dominated
    by smaller grains with size parameters x<1e4.

- Release 1.9.8 ::
  - Sparse scattering matrix files can save space if the target program
    can read them.
  - Literature standard compositions DIANA and DSHARP have been built
    in. They are accessible with the options =-diana=, =-dsharp=, and
    =-dsharp-no-ice=.

- Release 1.9.7 ::
  - Do not allow qabs to drop below 1e-4*qext, to avoid numerical
    problems.

- Release 1.9.6 ::
  - Log-normal size distribution is now a standard option, using
    =AMEAN:ASIG= instead of the powerlaw in the *-a* switch.  A
    negative value for =ASIG= triggers a normal (not log-normal)
    distribution around =AMEAN=, with =ASIG= interpreted as the width
    in micrometers.
  - The size distribution can also be read from a file.
  - The new option =-wgrid= makes =optool= write the size distribution
    and the wavelength grid into files =optool_sd.dat= and
    =optool_lam.dat=, respectively. These also serve as examples of
    what kind of file can be read in by =-l FILE= and =-a FILE=.
  - We no longer provide binary versions of =optool=.
  - The default number of size bins has been increased to 15 per grain
    size decade, to get better results at long wavelengths out of the
    box. This slows down the computation by 50%.

- Release 1.9.4 ::
  - Improve installation process and instructions.
  - Get help about specific command line options with, for example,
    =optool -h mmf=.
  - Shell completion of command line options and arguments is now
    supported with the =optool-complete= script.  You need to link it
    into your shell setup using the instructions in =optool-complete=.

- Release 1.9.3 ::
  - New option =-print=, to direct output to STDOUT instead of files.
  - Grain sizes and wavelengths can be specified on the command lines
    in units other than microns, for example mm or GHz (frequency) or
    cm^-1 (wavenumbers).
  - Add Fayalite and also the Mg-rich Olivine from Fabian 2001.
  - Switch out the Forsterite dataset: Steyer is out, Suto is in.
  - Continuous Distribution of Ellipsoids (CDE) approximation has been
    implemented.  It is only valid in the Rayleigh limit and includes
    quite extreme particle shapes, but it is good as a comparison and
    frequently used in the literature.
  - =optool -a 15 -2= will compute a size range from 13-17um with a
    flat size distribution.
  
- Release 1.9 ::
  - The proper reference for optool is now the entry in the
    [[https://ascl.net][Astrophysics Source Code Library]], please refer to it when optool
    is used in your paper.  The reference looks like this:
    - Dominik, C., Min, M., Tazaki, R. 2021, Optool, 1.9, Astrophysics
      Source Code Library, record ascl:2104.010 
    Here is a [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ascl.soft04010D][pointer to the ADS entry]], from where you can also
    download the corresponding BibTeX entry.  That BibTeX entry is
    also in =optool.bib=, with the citation key =2021ascl.soft04010D=.
  - Add an amorphous water ice, from Hudgins 1993.
    This dataset is amended at short and long wavelengths with the
    Warren data of crystalline ice, to get a wide dataset.
